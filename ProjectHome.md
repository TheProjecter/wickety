_wickety: (adj) when something is shady or unstable, and you don't quite know it is about; related to wicket;_

---

Wickety started because I don't know sh\*t about wicket and mostly all the tutorials I've found so far are either incomplete or focusing on the wrong things. or both.

And because I do believe I can do a better job at explaining and documenting most of this stuff and I believe I can provide better (more meaningful) examples for wicket and its possibilities for integration in java webapps, here I am contributing with my 5 cents.

To try wickety here's what you'll need to do:
  1. checkout a tag of the project (the trunk will also do but it might be unstable. well, right now the tags are also unstable, I'm still getting my bearings with google code and mvn release:prepare...);
  1. mvn clean install;
  1. cd wickety-web;
  1. mvn jetty:run;
  1. go to localhost:8080 and play around;
  1. open the source code in your favorite IDE and break things;
  1. go for beers.

Feel free to suggest corrections or use this code in any way that you feel like.
